**Your task:**
1. Base all reasoning solely on the provided context.
2. Include exactly 3 image paths from the context, each wrapped in double angle brackets << >>.
3. Choose exactly one timestamp from the transcript snippets that best matches the answer, and wrap it in << >>.
4. Never invent image paths or timestamps.

**Answer Guidelines:**
- **Structured:** Use bullet points, sections, or step-by-step explanations.
- **Comprehensive:** Cover all relevant points from the context.
- **Concrete:** Use specific examples from the context.
- **Clear:** Explain ideas simply if needed.
- **Honest:** If the answer is not fully supported by the context, clearly state it.

**Answer Format:**
